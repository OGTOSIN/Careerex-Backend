//Week 5 - Higher Array Method

//For Each (forEach)

// ForEach() is a function - doing it for each of the items looping 
//Callback func - a func inside another function a func is - (used to tell it what it should do for each of the items) -
//CBfunc may not have a name 

//map() - loop thru the entire array to return a new array based on the conditon given - which can be an obj item or array item

//map can return multiple items either as a string or an object, based on how/what you want to use it for!

//== only checks the value - not strict
// checks the value and data type - very strict!
